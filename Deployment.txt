Deployment instructions to deploy up to GitHub.
-----------------------------------------------

Make sure the solution compiles.
Open a windows explorer instance looking at the solution folder.
Type cmd in the path box.
In the cmd windows type:	dotnet publish -c Release
Using windows explorer navigate to:	BlazorMain > bin > Release > netstandard2.0 > publish > BlazorMain > dist
Open your GitHub account and navigate to the blazor-arcade project.
Drag all the files from windows explorer to your GitHub project page files area. This will take a minute to upload.
Click the green Commit button below your files, this will take a few minutes to complete.
Once the files are committed, go to the index.html page and edit it.
Place a trailing slash immediately after /blazor-arcade so it looks like this:	<base href="/blazor-arcade/" />
Commit the file.
Now navigate to the GitHub page URL to check it all runs OK. (URL: https://peterhick.github.io/blazor-arcade/)
